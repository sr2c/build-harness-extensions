  ** DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE

  ** This file was automatically generated by the `build-harness`.
  ** 1) Make all changes to `README.yaml`
  ** 2) Run `make init` (you only need to do this once)
  ** 3) Run`make readme` to rebuild this file.

Our extensions to Cloud Posse's [build-harness](https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness). Cloud Posse have made
a great collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Golang projects, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more. At SR2
Communications, our technologies sometimes differ from Cloud Posse's choice and sometimes they're the same. That's
why we're grateful that they've built us a way to add extensions to their framework to benefit from the existing
collection while also being able to work with the technologies that we work with every day.

Our primary technologies are:

* Ansible
* Docker Compose (existing Cloud Posse module)
* GitLab
* Python
* Terraform (existing Cloud Posse module)

## Usage



Add this repository as a submodule in your existing repository:

```bash
git submodule add https://gitlab.com/sr2c/build-harness-extensions.git
```

### Simple usage

Add a Makefile to the project like:

```make
SHELL := /bin/bash

export README_TEMPLATE_FILE ?= build-harness-extensions/templates/README.md.gotmpl

-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
```

### Terraform module

You can add additional variables to adjust the behaviour of the targets, for a Terraform module for example:

```make
SHELL := /bin/bash

export HELP_FILTER ?= help|terraform|lint
export README_TEMPLATE_FILE ?= build-harness-extensions/templates/README.md.gotmpl

# List of targets the `readme` target should call before generating the readme
export README_DEPS ?= docs/targets.md docs/terraform.md

-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness"; echo .build-harness)

## Lint terraform code
lint:
	$(SELF) terraform/install terraform/get-modules terraform/lint terraform/validate tflint
```

## Trans Rights

![Trans Rights Are Human Rights][trans_rights]

Trans is an umbrella term to describe people whose gender is not the same as, or does not sit comfortably with, the
sex they were assigned at birth. *Like all people*, they have the right to be treated with dignity and respect and to
have their human rights protected.

Transgender people face significant discrimination and prejudice in many areas of their lives, including employment,
education, housing, and healthcare. They are also at increased risk of violence and hate crimes. These issues
can have a serious impact on the physical and mental well-being of transgender people and can prevent them from fully
participating in society.

Transgender rights are therefore an important part of the broader struggle for human rights. Everyone, regardless of
their gender identity, should be able to live their lives free from discrimination and to enjoy the same rights and
opportunities as everyone else. This includes the right to express their gender identity and to be treated with respect
and dignity.

It is important for society to recognize and respect the rights of transgender people, and to take steps to address the
discrimination and prejudice that they face. This can include supporting policies and laws that protect transgender
people from discrimination and promoting acceptance and understanding of transgender people within the broader
community.

* [Gendered Intelligence](https://genderedintelligence.co.uk/) is a trans-led and trans-involving grassroots organisation
  with a wealth of lived experience, community connections of many kinds, and a depth and breadth of trans community
  knowledge. They offer staff training, consultancy, youth work, mentoring and undertake public engagement activities.

* [TransAid Cymru](https://transaid.cymru/) began life as a local mutual aid group in Cardiff. Tired of the ways that the
  electoral political system had let the trans community down, they decided it was time to do something for themselves.
  Many of the founding members were disabled and unemployed. Familiar with the real, material needs of the trans
  community and how little support there was out there, they founded the mutual aid group in order to provide the services
  the trans community needed.

If you have the means and you have benefited from this open source project, please consider making a donation to either
(or both) of the above groups.
