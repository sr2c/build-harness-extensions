  Our extensions to Cloud Posse's [build-harness](https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness). Cloud Posse have made
  a great collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Golang projects, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more. At SR2
  Communications, our technologies sometimes differ from Cloud Posse's choice and sometimes they're the same. That's
  why we're grateful that they've built us a way to add extensions to their framework to benefit from the existing
  collection while also being able to work with the technologies that we work with every day.
  
  Our primary technologies are:
  
  * Ansible
  * Docker Compose (existing Cloud Posse module)
  * GitLab
  * Python
  * Terraform (existing Cloud Posse module)
usage: |-
  
  ### Simple usage
  
  Add a Makefile to the project like:
  
  ```make
  SHELL := /bin/bash

  export README_TEMPLATE_FILE ?= build-harness-extensions/templates/README.md.gotmpl

  -include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness-ext "https://gitlab.com/sr2c/build-harness-extensions/-/raw/feat/install-script/Makefile.bootstrap"; echo .build-harness-ext)
  ```
  
  ### Terraform module
  
  You can add additional variables to adjust the behaviour of the targets, for a Terraform module for example:
  
  ```make
  SHELL := /bin/bash

  export HELP_FILTER ?= help|terraform|lint
  export README_TEMPLATE_FILE ?= build-harness-extensions/templates/README.md.gotmpl

  # List of targets the `readme` target should call before generating the readme
  export README_DEPS ?= docs/targets.md docs/terraform.md

  -include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness-ext "https://gitlab.com/sr2c/build-harness-extensions/-/raw/feat/install-script/Makefile.bootstrap"; echo .build-harness-ext)

  ## Lint terraform code
  lint:
  	$(SELF) terraform/install terraform/get-modules terraform/lint terraform/validate tflint
  ```
